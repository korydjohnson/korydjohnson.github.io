 	  <h2> Background </h2>
	  <p> I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Institute for Statistics and Mathematics
		at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. 
	I completed my PhD in statistics at  
	    <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/", target = "_blank"> 
		The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania</a> and was co-advised by
	    <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~stine/", target = "_blank">Robert Stine</a> and 
	    <a href="http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/~foster/index.pl", target = "_blank">Dean Foster</a>. </p>

	<p> My research is motivated by transparent machine learning methods. This includes 
		valid and computationally efficient versions of forward stepwise regression, 
		post-processing methods to correct the estimates of any algorithm to ensure 
		fairness, and valid prediction intervals for ``black-box'' models such as deep 
		neural networks and random forests. My work on forward stepwise allows one to 
		search complex interaction spaces while controlling for false rejections. There
		is a publicly available R package that can be used to fit these models:
		<a href="https://github.com/korydjohnson/rai", target="_blank">rai</a>.
		Fairness aware data mining (<a href="http://www.fatml.org/", target="_blank">FATML</a>)
		considers the reverse problem to 
		feature selection: the discrete removal of the influence of a covariate. Merely 
		excluding a covariate such as race does not necessarily remove its influence due 
		to its relationship with other covariates. My work effectively separates 
		prediction and fairness goals, allowing modelers to focus on generating highly 
		predictive models without incorporating the constraint of fairness. Lastly, the 
		prediction intervals are distribution-free, in that they only require 
		independent and identically distributed data. Their construction 
		is transparent enough that their use should become standard practice, much like 
		reporting standard errors along with mean estimates. </p>
