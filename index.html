 	  <h2> Background </h2>
  
  <p> 
During my academic career I have transitioned between multiple institutions, 
taught and developed a wide variety of courses at the bachelor and master's 
level, as well as conducted research in disparate fields. This has culminated 
in a diverse skill set that has been tuned to rigorously analyze new problems and 
improve upon state-of-the-art methods in multiple domains. I have spent many 
years surrounded by statistical problems in business, economics, and epidemiology, 
and I have both used and taught a diverse array of tools to solve them. This includes 
classical, nonparametric, and Bayesian statistics as well as 
optimization, machine learning, and neural networks. R is my primary 
programming language, and I use Python for my work on neural networks.
I enjoy the translation of problems in an application area to concrete statistical tasks and am always eager to explore new methods and applications. 
This translation is what separates the naive application of statistical and 
machine learning techniques from the insights that they are able to generate.
</p>

<p>
My research covers two broad domains: data-focused statistical analysis in 
epidemiology and fairness-aware data mining, and methodology within transparent 
machine learning. In all of these fields, I have written internationally 
recognized publications as well as publicly available R packages
which are available on <a href="https://github.com/korydjohnson/", target="_blank">github</a>. Doing so 
required identifying where value could be added, then developing both the 
theoretical and computational tools to provide it.
